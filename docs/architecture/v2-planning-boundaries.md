# V2 technical planning boundaries

The [architecture](architecture-v2.md), [domain model](blockout-domain-model-v2.md)
and [transition design](v1-v2-transition-architecture.md) constrain the bounded
feature plans under [#248](https://github.com/blockoutproject/blockout/issues/248).
This is a dependency and interface map, not a task-status ledger, generated
tasks.md, execution authorization or replacement for official Spec Kit procedures.

## Sources and design authority

Accepted specifications remain the functional authority. Use the specification
directories below rather than inferring F-numbers from directory prefixes.
The final [#298 acceptance](https://github.com/blockoutproject/blockout/issues/298#issuecomment-5969051828)
under [#272](https://github.com/blockoutproject/blockout/issues/272) identifies the
accepted design/prototype handoff. The accepted prototype behavior revision is
`25875456e021424df3d682dbd414caf8ecdcdfdf`; the specification snapshot identified by
that handoff is `7880bfd7d7f6bf223805cef56428ab8a63768c2f`. This pins evidence, not
permission to read a separate repository or adopt prototype implementation choices.

- [Blockout UI Library](https://www.figma.com/design/l8EIQApzbfM24FwR0WKyAC/Blockout-UI-Library)
  owns foundations and components.
- [Blockout Product Design](https://www.figma.com/design/rKu4xc8eJsx0f0Vu4E6U03/Blockout-Product-Design)
  owns patterns/screens: Access `723:2`, System `723:3`, Home `888:8`, Discovery
  `916:2825`, Sport `976:283`, Account `1087:6`, Administration `1170:3654`.
- The final accepted corrections include notification local cleanup on open/resume
  from 29 elapsed days and active exclusion by day 30, stale response/count
  protection, minimal consumed facts, 44-point search targets, provider-owned UMP
  interaction and the approved privacy icon, and a single-line retry label.
- Browser/prototype checks establish the reviewed interaction behavior only. Native
  SDKs, purchases, provider settings, backend purge, production load and restoration
  remain qualification obligations. Earlier full-browser assertion failures are
  not transformed into a claim of a completely rerun suite by later targeted checks.

Feature plans must link their exact approved journeys/states and reconcile any
later specification amendments. Product changes return to the owning specification
and design authority. Do not silently alter accepted behavior in a technical plan.

## Planning dependencies and owned outputs

Start with F13's shared runtime/contract envelope, F02's sports identities and F05's
account identities. This establishes interfaces consumed elsewhere, not an
instruction to implement infrastructure before testing product flows. F14 begins
its protected-state inventory design early and converges after the owners of the
imported obligations. F13 qualification converges again once the whole graph exists.

F13 establishes common mechanics but does not own every business failure rule.
F11 establishes privacy constraints early; its detailed mobile plan can consume
F09 without delaying those constraints. F12 exposes permissions/access interfaces
before administrative screens are independently planned. These interface-first
dependencies avoid circular feature planning without introducing shared ownership.

Use the applicable installed official speckit-plan, speckit-checklist,
speckit-tasks and speckit-analyze procedures for actual feature artifacts. Each
plan carries its research decisions, derived model/contracts and verification
guidance. Cross-plan contradictions must be resolved before deriving bounded
implementation issues with the official tasks-to-issues capability. A referenced
task identifier includes its feature directory, since T001 is not globally unique.

## Intended final code boundaries

These are target locations for feature plans, not a request to move current V1
projects now. Keep V1 paths/builds viable throughout preparation.

| Target area                  | Intended location and responsibility                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Java deployable entry points | `apps/v2/api`, `apps/v2/business-worker`, `apps/v2/integration-worker`, `apps/v2/scheduler`; thin composition of owned modules.                                                                         |
| Java module libraries        | `libs/v2/backend/<owner>`; explicit application API, domain, persistence and provider adapters where populated.                                                                                         |
| Python collection            | `apps/v2/acquisition`; provider packages and shared runtime only where semantics are identical. Family selection is configuration, not four mandatory codebases.                                        |
| Transition executable        | `apps/v2/migration`; legacy readers, manifests, transformation and operator composition. Imports use the Sport owner, not direct arbitrary SQL.                                                         |
| Mobile application/features  | `apps/v2/mobile`, `libs/v2/mobile/<feature>` and narrow shared native/UI libraries. Route tree stays within the application; state belongs to its feature.                                              |
| Contracts                    | Existing source-first contract authority at `libs/shared/contracts/specs/source`, with explicit V2 namespaces and generated outputs kept out of Git. Old consumers remain buildable during preparation. |
| Database migrations          | `infra/v2/database`; one Liquibase root with ordered owner-specific changelogs and dedicated migration image/job.                                                                                       |
| Deployment/protection        | `infra/v2`; Dokploy definitions, per-environment configuration templates and restore/recovery procedures, without secrets or production snapshots.                                                      |

Nx owns dependency edges and affected task selection. Maven owns Java compilation,
uv owns Python environments and Expo tooling owns mobile/native builds. Contract
changes deliberately broaden verification to all affected consumers; an inferred
Nx graph alone is insufficient evidence of complete cross-language validation.

## Required cross-plan interface decisions

| Boundary                                 | Decisions to derive without changing the architecture                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collection to Sport                      | Versioned normalized observation schema; target/generation/config context; per-item outcome and whole-calendar completion evidence; stale and duplicate handling. |
| Sport to readers/search                  | Effective projection fields, revision/watermark, current restriction check, cursor expiration and atomic generation cutover protocol.                             |
| Following/contributions to Notifications | Exact audience-capture linearization point and lock order; relationship continuity; composition under reversed delivery order; allowance uniqueness.              |
| Identity to suppliers                    | Principal/customer correspondence; account generation and fences; provider mutation state; limits on recreation and restore.                                      |
| Support to GitHub/media                  | Immutable operation/manifest identity; private operator authorization; final-complete proof; uncertain-create reconciliation without duplicate dossiers.          |
| Migration to Sport                       | Qualified identity/media import, optimistic target revision, stable source revision and no-op/rejection behavior for replay/stale runs.                           |
| Commit to external effect                | Outbox durability and acknowledgement boundary; remote WAL flush evidence before protected effects; bounded wait and uncertain commit recovery.                   |

These are detailed protocol tasks within selected boundaries, not deferred choices
between technologies/topologies. If qualification disproves a structural choice,
record the evidence and revise the architecture explicitly before implementation
depends on a different solution.

## Qualification gates and conditioned decisions

| Gate                    | Experiment and pass condition                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Failure arbitration                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Complete load           | F13 one-hour workload, 1,000 active users, about 100 actions/s; current plus three historical seasons; cold/warm/new data; collectors/projections active; per-family complete correct response accounting with >=95% under two seconds | Profile queries, response fan-out, locks, concurrency and resource sizing; repeat affected protocol. No launch capacity claim until passed.                                          |
| Collection              | FFVB CSV/discovery and LNV fixtures; complete/partial/empty/malformed/contradictory context; rate limiting; stop/resume/overrun; fencing and late results; success separated from integration                                          | Fix provider/coordination behavior and tune measured admission. Do not meet cadence by ignoring supplier limits or redefining absence.                                               |
| Search                  | Accepted relevance corpus; multi-term cross-field matches, direct-before-typo, prefixes/aliases, strict filters, more than 10,000 results, changes during pagination, hidden/stale fields, rebuild while updating                      | Correct analyzers/query/projection protocol. Reopen engine decision only if required semantics cannot be met, not merely because a default setting fails.                            |
| Transactions/work       | Concurrent quota/moderation/classification/follow cases; process death and network loss before/after commit, publish, confirm, ack and supplier response; broker loss                                                                  | Repair protocol until no duplicated business effect or stale overwrite; quarantine uncertainty rather than claim exactly-once transport.                                             |
| Native baseline         | Signed iOS/Android builds, actual Auth0, purchases/restore, UMP, push, Mapbox bridge, files, deep links, lifecycle and accessibility                                                                                                   | Fix adapter/version compatibility; Expo 56 with the same OS minimum is the specified fallback if 57 is blocked. Further structural change requires explicit architecture revision.   |
| Identity/Pro continuity | Every retained historical/anonymous/linked category, full subscriber reconciliation, Apple and Google including erasure/restoration and independent rights/gifts                                                                       | Preserve evidence and block affected destructive steps/transfer path. A normal test purchase is insufficient.                                                                        |
| Club migration          | Complete inventory, file bytes/checksums, certain versus ambiguous mapping, duplicates, changed/deleted associations, replay after partial failure and stale run after V2 edit                                                         | Fix preservation/import; missing bytes block destruction. Keep certain preserved-but-unmatched associations for resolution.                                                          |
| Durability/restore      | Receiver disconnect, local commit visible before remote flush, disk/slot pressure, total primary loss, old backup plus newer erasure/allowance facts, file recovery and derivative rebuild                                             | No silent durability downgrade. Fix bounded waits and effect fence; suspend affected access when obligations cannot be established. Measure recovery duration, do not invent an RTO. |
| Delivery/access         | Interrupted Liquibase/deployment, mixed compatible workers, actual two-store availability, server-side V1 retirement, maintenance/minimum version and owner recovery                                                                   | Correct compatibility/operating procedure before cutover; an image rollback is not data rollback.                                                                                    |

The experiments are future evidence obligations, not completed tests. Exact
patch locks, schemas, retention values and reproducible fixture/load definitions
belong in the owning approved feature plans; no runtime component may ship with
an undefined operational policy merely because this architecture names its owner.

## Constitution check

| Principle                                   | Architecture consequence                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Specification-led intent                    | Every owner/qualification row links accepted scope; no service layout is inferred from V1. Product changes return to specifications. |
| Domain integrity                            | One runtime owner per resource; shared V2 model constrains identities, lifecycle and cross-domain invariants.                        |
| Design-ready UI                             | Accepted Figma/prototype evidence is identified with native/provider limits; feature plans bind exact affected journeys.             |
| Source-first contracts                      | V2 source schemas precede generated consumers; generated projections remain ignored and reproducible.                                |
| Verifiable simplicity                       | Alternatives, failure consequences and experiments are explicit; no assumed throughput, provider compatibility or automatic HA.      |
| Official procedures / operational ownership | This map does not replace Spec Kit procedures or track assignments/completion. Issues/PRs retain execution and acceptance evidence.  |

No constitutional exception is selected. Runtime feature implementation follows
approved detailed plans/tasks and the phase gate; recording this architecture is
not equivalent to deploying the rebuild or qualifying production continuity.
