# Documentation

Blockout V2 is a complete rebuild of the backend, ingestion and mobile application, including mobile internals.
V1 source, tests, contracts and architecture documents record historical behavior and transition dependencies;
they are not the V2 target or a default architecture to preserve. Technical reuse requires justification from
accepted V2 requirements and approved plans. Accepted functional semantics, design evidence and explicit continuity
constraints remain binding under the [constitution](../.specify/memory/constitution.md).

Accepted feature specifications live under [`specs/`](../specs/). Technical plans and tasks are derived per feature through the
official Spec Kit workflow and are not part of the repository foundation.
The [V2 roadmap](https://github.com/blockoutproject/blockout/issues/245) schedules architecture decisions after
acceptance of the complete specifications and global functional/design reviews. Architecture child issues under
[#248](https://github.com/blockoutproject/blockout/issues/248) are created after that gate, before implementation tasks.
